## 🧭 Overview
**Novaria** is a console-based Java application that simulates a real-world library ecosystem.  
It demonstrates **object-oriented programming** concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and composition — through interactive library operations.

## 🎯 Features
- 📚 Add and manage books in a central library  
- 👥 Create and manage users with unique profiles  
- ✍️ Associate books with authors  
- 💾 Save and open books from personal libraries  
- 🕮 Read books directly through the Reader module  
- 🧠 Track reading history per user
